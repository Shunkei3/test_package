## Create data-raw folder to store raw datasets 

If you are creating datasets from raw datasets that are obtained externally, you can store them in a folder called **data_raw**, which is created by running the following code. Running the code also generates a file named **DATASET.R**.

```{r}
usethis::use_data_raw()
```

## Create datasets

Inside **DATASET.R**, you can write R codes to generate datasets. But, you do not really have to use this file. You can just create a new one for this purpose. Here, I will create a file named **gen_data.qmd** under the **data-raw** folder. Go visit the file and come back here once you are done creating a dataset there.

## Create (update) documentation

```{r}
usethis::use_package("sf")
```

```{r}
devtools::document()
```
